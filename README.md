```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update the `.env` file with your AWS configuration:
```env
VITE_AWS_REGION=us-west-1
VITE_AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your-user-pool-id
VITE_AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
VITE_API_BASE_URL=your-api-base-url
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
```

4. Deploy the admin backend:
```bash
serverless deploy --config admin-serverless.yml
```

## Deployment

### Deploy Frontend to AWS

1. Build the production bundle:
```bash
cd admin-dashboard
npm run build
```

2. Create an S3 bucket for hosting:
```bash
aws s3 mb s3://breakfree-admin-dashboard
```

3. Enable static website hosting:
```bash
aws s3 website s3://breakfree-admin-dashboard --index-document index.html
```

4. Upload the build files:
```bash
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://breakfree-admin-dashboard
```

5. (Optional) Set up CloudFront distribution for HTTPS and better performance

### Deploy Backend to AWS

1. Deploy the admin Lambda functions:
```bash
cd backend
serverless deploy --config admin-serverless.yml
```

2. Note the API endpoint URL from the deployment output

3. Update the frontend `.env` file with the API URL

4. Rebuild and redeploy the frontend

## Initial Admin User Setup

To create the first admin user, you'll need to manually add a record to the AdminUsers DynamoDB table:

```bash
# Generate password hash
node -e "const crypto = require('crypto'); const salt = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex'); const password = 'YourSecurePassword'; const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(password + salt).digest('hex'); console.log('Salt:', salt, '\nHash:', hash);"
```

Then, add the admin user to DynamoDB:

```json
{
  "email": "admin@breakfree.com",
  "adminId": "admin-001",
  "name": "Admin User",
  "role": "admin",
  "passwordHash": "generated-hash-from-above",
  "salt": "generated-salt-from-above",
  "status": "active",
  "createdAt": 1696963200000,
  "updatedAt": 1696963200000
}
```

**Important**: In production, use bcrypt instead of SHA256 for password hashing.
